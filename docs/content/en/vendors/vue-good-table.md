PhilaUI currently does not have a table component, as there are many third-party components that provide advanced functionality.

We recommend using [vue-good-table](https://xaksis.github.io/vue-good-table/) which is compatible with our [table styles](/styles/tables).

## Using PhilaUI's table class

```html
<vue-good-table :columns="columns" :rows="rows" style-class="table" />
```

## Live examples

### Using the .table class

<example name="VueGoodTable1" height="400"></example>
