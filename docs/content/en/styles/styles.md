PhilaUI styles are built on top of the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework and based off of the City of Philadelphia [Digital Standards](https://standards.phila.gov/).

## Adding styles to a project

Please see the [installation-and-usage](/installation-and-usage#styles) section for more information on how to import styles into a project.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

PhilaUI adheres to WCAG's [AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance) level.

### Wave tool

Using the [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) browser extension to check for possible style issues such as color contrast, font sizes, and headings hierarchy is highly recommended.
