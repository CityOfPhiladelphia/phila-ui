## Intro

PhilaUI uses the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons library. Although it's not required, projects for the City of Philadelphia may have access to the pro license. Please contact the Software Engineering team to request a key.

## FontAwesome Pro

Please refer to FontAwesome's npm [documentation](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/using-package-managers) to learn more about adding the pro license to a project.
