## Font Families

PhilaUI currently uses two Google fonts. The fonts are currently linked from the Phila.gov site.

- **Open Sans**: most text content, eg. paragraphs, lists...
- **Montserrat**: mainly used for headings and specific components

## Font Awesome Pro

PhilaUI uses Font Awesome Pro as its icon library. A pro key is required and available upon request for city projects.
